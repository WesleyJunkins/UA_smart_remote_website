    <h1>Project Description</h1>
    <p>This project is an app to connect to a wood burning stove. This app will be able to control the thermostat of the stove. It will also be able to read and display some values collected by the furnace. The app will be able to connect to the furnace through the internet, allowing control and data collection to happen remotely. The technical implementation of this, as well as instructions for using these APIs, will be discussed in this document. We will also discuss the layout of the code, the libraries we used, and usernames and passwords for accessing any of these features. In addition to this, some tips for how to scale the functionality of this project to either include better functionality or to work for more devices will be included. This documentation contains everything that is needed to understand and use the Crimson Furnace system.</p>
